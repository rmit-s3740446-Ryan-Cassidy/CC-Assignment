The application was created as a way to usefully visualise information that could be retrieved from publicly available transport datasets.
In this project we have made an application called ‘Coordinate Mapper’. This app takes in a csv/txt file as an input. The files used, contain a set of coordinates for one particular metro route in Melbourne. However this can work with any kind of coordinate collection. The app then displays this route on a map to the user. The user can email the screenshot of the map showing the image.
